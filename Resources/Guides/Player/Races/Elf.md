# Elf

Elves are a graceful and ancient race known for their keen senses, natural agility, and long lives. Here are the key points you need to know about playing an Elf:

## Traits

- **Ability Score Increase:** Elves typically have a higher Dexterity score, reflecting their agility and grace. They also gain a boost to their Intelligence score.
- **Ageless:** Elves mature at about the same rate as humans, but they can live for centuries, remaining vigorous and active well into their old age.
- **Keen Senses:** Elves have keen senses, granting them proficiency in Perception.
- **Fey Ancestry:** Elves have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and can't be put to sleep by magic.
- **Trance:** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply for 4 hours each day, gaining the same benefits as a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

## Subraces

Elves can choose from several subraces, each with its own unique abilities and characteristics:

- **High Elf:** High Elves are more common and have a natural affinity for magic. They gain proficiency in one additional skill, as well as the ability to learn one wizard cantrip.
- **Wood Elf:** Wood Elves are masters of the wilderness, with increased speed and proficiency in stealth. They also gain the ability to hide when lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.
- **Dark Elf (Drow):** Drow are dark-skinned elves who dwell in the depths of the Underdark. They have superior darkvision, proficiency in the use of the hand crossbow, shortsword, and rapier, and can cast the *dancing lights* cantrip once per day.

## Role in the Party

- **Agile Combatant:** Elves excel in combat, using their natural agility and keen senses to outmaneuver their foes.
- **Skilled Scout:** With their proficiency in Perception and Stealth, Elves make excellent scouts and ambushers, able to navigate difficult terrain and remain unseen.
- **Magic Affinity:** High Elves, in particular, make powerful spellcasters, wielding arcane magic with finesse and precision.
